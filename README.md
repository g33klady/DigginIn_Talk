#Digging In: Getting Familiar With The Code To Be A Better Tester

Abstract: Maybe you’ve been testing the same application for a while, and your rate of finding new bugs has slowed. Or you’re trying to find more ways to figure out what your devs are doing day to day. You have the tools at your disposal, you just need to dig in!

In this talk, Hilary Weaver-Robb shares tools and techniques you can use to take your testing to the next level. See everything the developers are changing, and learn to find the most vulnerable parts of the code. These tools and techniques can help you focus your testing, and track down those pesky bugs!

Takeaways:

* tools to do static analysis on the code
* using those tools to find potential bugs
* using commit logs to figure out what’s being changed
* that it’s helpful to dig into the code of the application under test
